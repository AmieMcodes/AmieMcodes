👋 Hi, I’m Amie Marse

I’m a React-focused full-stack developer who builds **real-world AI systems** with an emphasis on reliability, thoughtful architecture, and human-centered workflows.

I’m especially interested in projects where technology needs to behave **predictably and responsibly** — not just impress in a demo.

---

## What I build
- AI-assisted applications with **deterministic logic** where it matters
- Voice-enabled and visual preview systems
- Tools that reduce uncertainty and support better decisions
- Software designed for **real usage, QA, and iteration**, not hype

---

## Tech stack
React · Vite · Tailwind  
Node.js · Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage)  
Netlify  
Voice AI (ElevenLabs)  
Product & payment tooling (Payhip, Stripe integrations)

## Featured work

### **AI Restaurant Call Center**
A deterministic, voice-enabled restaurant ordering system with call simulation, order state modeling, and developer debugging tools.  
Built to prioritize reliability, auditability, and real-world call flow over generative unpredictability.

### **Tint & Ceramic Visualizer — Workflow Demo**
A sanitized portfolio demo showcasing a **user-centered visual preview workflow** for local service businesses.

The goal is simple: reduce uncertainty, build confidence, and help customers understand what they’re buying *before* money changes hands.

From an engineering standpoint, the focus is on:
- predictable, repeatable image processing
- clear separation between UI and backend logic
- guardrails and fallbacks that keep the experience stable
- using AI as an enhancement — not the centerpiece

### **No Shame AI**
A collection of practical AI tools and workflows designed to support real life and real constraints, especially for non-technical users.

## A note on this GitHub
This profile exists to share **code, architecture, and problem-solving approaches**.

Public repositories are intentionally sanitized and brand-agnostic, with an emphasis on how systems are designed rather than who they were built for.

If something here resonates, feel free to explore the code.
